            <h3>Cyrillic alphabet</h3>
            <p> 
                Cyrllic was introduced in the 1940s in the Mongolian People's Republic under Soviet influence.
                The Cyrillic script had many advantages over the traditional Mongolian including having clear certain 
                letters such as "t" and "d," "o" and "u" which were frequently confused in traditional script, and simple & easy
                shapes thats consistent regardless of position unlike the Mongolian script.

            <h3>Why Learn the Traditional Mongolian Script?</h3>
            <p> 
                Although Cyrillic has been the dominant script since the 1940s, the traditional Mongolian script remains a vital 
                part of Mongolia’s cultural identity. Its elegant vertical form connects modern Mongolians to 
                their rich history, classical literature, and centuries-old traditions. With Mongolia's 2025 bilingual 
                policy requiring both scripts in official documents, learning the traditional script is not just about
                preserving heritage—it's about preparing for the future.
